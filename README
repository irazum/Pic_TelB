This is the Picture telegram bot.
The bot uses aiogramm api, asyncio, aiohttp and aiomysql.
The bot runs on Heroku.com, the database runs on Amazon RDS.
---------------------------------------------------
The bot loads links to random photos for each category from API Pexels. 
Then the app uploads them to the MySQL database and to the local container.
Depending on the choice of users the bot sends them random photos from chosen category.
A user can like a photo and then he gets a link to this photo in the original resolution.
Heroku restarts the bot once a day and the bot updates its urls-container. If API Pexels
crashes than the container downloads links from the database.
Once a day bot sends 3 pictures to each user who uses the bot.
Also the bot has 8 commands for admins to display statistics.
