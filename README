This is the Picture telegram bot.
The bot uses aiogramm api, asyncio, aiohttp and aiomysql.
The bot runed on Heroku.com, the database runed on Amazon RDS.
---------------------------------------------------
It loads links on random photos for each desired category and their authors from API Pexels to MySQL database and
in a local container.
Then the bot answers users` requests.
Depending on the choice of users the bot sends them random photos from choosed category.
A user can likes photo and then he gets a link on this photo in the original resolution.
Heroku restarts the bot once a day and the bot updates its urls-container. If API Pexels 
crashes than the container filled from database.  
Once a day bot sends 3 pictures to each user who used the bot.
Also the bot has 8 commands for admins to display statistic. Current statistics commands 
shows statistic for last hour. Total statistic uploads data from database and shows 
statistic for all time.
